# Extra notes

Classical probabilistic languages work by creating a model, and then searching parameters within the model.
The parts about a model that are known are coded beforehand using composites of exchangable random primitives.
Quantum computing possibly assists in this process, because quantum computers are fundamentally probabilistic.
Qubits are generally the exchangable random primitives that a classical approach would use as building blocks. 
For instance, a qubit that has undergone a hadamard gate is, when measured, equivalent to a coin flip.
Multiple qubits can be used to represent an arbitrary statistical state, when the state is known beforehand.
However, there is another element here, which is entanglement.
Entanglement allows conditioning of other probabilities based on simpler probabilities.
Its classical corollary is the post-measurement if statement.

Given a quantum computer with n qubits, we can generate a multinomial sample with 2^n options in a relative number of operations.
Any other distribution can be approximated with our multinomial distribution.
Additionally, it is very easy to "cross" or join distributions, and so we can simulate a very complicated process with a smaller number of inputs and operations.
For instance, crossing two m-wide multinomial distributions can give m^2 options with O(m) operations and inputs.

Something worth considering: Quantum computers are much better at building a single measurement, rather than approximating a distribution?
We can use grover's algorithm, or a variant of it, however, to do unstructured search in O(sqrt(n)) time.

Other applications allow a speedup that changes O(2^n) to O(n). 
This is potentially more interesting, because of the nature of the speedup.
Stated casually, this speedup is possible when we have a number of probabilistically interacting parts, and we care about observing a single measurement at the end of simulation.
This is very similar to a hofstadterian cognitive architecture, or any classical agent-based system. 


Consider an existing probabilistic programming language: Church.

In church, one of my favorite models is the following:

```scheme
(define (transition nonterminal depth)
  (case nonterminal
        (('atom)      (terms '(x 1 2)))
        (('operator)  (terms '(+ *)))
        (('predicate) (terms '(odd even)))
        (('expression) (multinomial (list '(atom)
                                          '(operator expression expression))
                                    (list (/ 3 4) (/ depth 4))))
        (('repeat) (just (list (terminal- 'repeat)
                                'expression
                                'expression)))
        (('range) (just (list (terminal- 'range)
                              'expression
                              'expression)))
        (('list-literal) (multinomial (list (list (terminal- 'list)
                                                  'expression)
                                            (list
                                                  (terminal- 'append)
                                                  'list-literal
                                                  'list-literal))
                                      (list (/ 3 4) (/ depth 4))))
        (('list-literal) (multinomial (list (list (terminal- 'list)
                                                  'expression))
                                            (list (terminal- 'append)
                                                  'list-literal
                                                  'list-literal)
                                      (list (/ 3 4) (/ depth 4))))
        (('list-type) (just '(list-literal range repeat)))
        (('concat) (multinomial (list (list (terminal- 'append)
                                            'list-type)
                                      (list (terminal- 'append)
                                            'list-type
                                            'concat))
                                (list (/ 3 4) (/ depth 4))))
        (('predicate-expr) (from depth (list '((predicate expression)))))
        (('conditional) (just (list (terminal- 'if) 
                                     'predicate
                                     'high-level
                                     'high-level)))
        (('high-level) (multinomial (list '(concat) '(atom)      '(conditional))
                                    (list (/ 3 8)    (/ 3 8) (/ depth 4))))
        (else 'error)))
```

This particular example is a multinomial distribution of list descriptions in the python programming language.
Suppose we want to find the computer program that describes a piece of data.
We can find this program by running grovers search, on the condition that our code matches our data.
In this way, we find an answer in sqrt(exp(n)) time. I'm not sure if this is interesting...?
