\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

    Programming quantum computers currently requires specialized knowledge. 
    This project aims to prototype a higher-level, quantum-classical-hybrid programming language for expressing probabilistic computations easily.
    The MIT cognitive science community has produced many developments using probabilistic programming languages [cite]. 
    Classical probabilistic programming builds models from building blocks called exchangeable random primitives. 
    Similarly, quantum programming uses qubits, which are have complex probability amplitudes and may similarly be building blocks for models.
    This paper presents the prototype for a quantum programming language which offers novel abstractions not yet available in existing quantum programming languages.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{Q}{uantum} computing is still in a nascent form, especially when it comes to programming interfaces. 
Many acclaimed quantum programming languages are simply circuit description languages that add superfluous syntax to have the look and feel of a traditional programming language.
These interfaces generally lack abstraction, which is an essential feature of any programming language.
In addition, a good number of quantum programming languages do not compile to run on actual hardware.
A simple circuit language like QASM does not provide the hybrid computation like QUIL does.
In effect, most quantum languages that do anything non-trivial are still circuit-assembly languages.
The world of classical programming languages was revolutionized with the invention of the C programming language, which is now ubiquitous in today's software either in either its original or derivative forms [Cite]. 
When C was created, it replaced assembly and eased the production of many important systems.
For instance, the unix operating system was re-written in C, which greatly reduced its complexity.

Since quantum computers are inherently probabilistic, a quantum programming language can draw inspiration from classical probabilistic programming.
Classical probabilistic programming languages are a recent innovation from the MIT cognitive science community. 
Essentially, they create a way for non-expert programmers to access the power of Bayesian inference. 
Users can create simple probabilistic models in standard code, and then run them through an expert-created inference backend.
Famously, this has resulted in dramatically reduced code complexity, with a famous case where a 50-line probabilistic program could compete with traditional approaches to face recognition [TODO: Cite].

Both quantum computing and classical probabilistic programming have variables which are probability distributions.
In quantum computing, measuring a single qubit results in $0$ or $1$, which represents a bernoulli trial, even though the qubit's pre-measurement state is richer (because its true representation is a complex probability amplitude).
If this is repeated multiple times, it creates a binomial distribution.
Similarly, measuring multiple ($n$) qubits gives a bitstring $(0, 1)^n$. 
If this is repeated multiple times, it creates a multinomial distribution.

Quantum states are richer than standard probability distributions.
The simplest case is a Bell state, where, for instance, one may measure $00$ or $11$ with equal probability\dots [TODO: Extend]

\section{Background}

\section{Curry}

Curry builds atop the innovations of Rigetti pyquil.
Pyquil is simply used as a compilation target for higher level constructs.
For example, pyquil does not provide a native ``if`` statement, and istead relies on hardcoded jumps.
The if statement is the simplest element in Curry:

Simply change (if (condition) (branch) (branch))
into
``
Condition
Measure []
Jump label
branch
branch etc
``

Curry also supports variable naming, blocks of qubits, classical callbacks, imports, \dots
Curry can be called as a library and operated from python

The backend for code generation allows different targets, such as google Circ.

%% These resulting multinomial distributions can, in theory, represent everything, but are often made to amplify a single state such that it can be found with high probability after doing multiple experiments. This is done because $n$ qubits have at most $2^n$ possible measurement outcomes and it is difficult to estimate the true probability distribution?. -> Not certain about this please research more

% # Brainstorm for a Probabilistic Quantum Programming Language
% 
% Modern quantum programming, despite its progress, is still esoteric to the average programmer. 
% In general, programming languages offer a midway point between a person's mental model and literal machine instructions.
% So, the question to be resolved is: How do most programmers model algorithms, and what intermediates can make it easier to turn mental models into code?
% 
% There are two main goals for providing abstractions in quantum programming:
%  - Allow novices to more quickly create useful and interesting models
%  - Allow experienced programmers to create models more efficiently, so that they can focus on more important design aspects
% 
% Previous attempts at designing quantum programming languages can give insights for the design of new ones:
% First, there are circuit languages, which provide no abstraction, but are useful for interfacing with normal languages or compiling into.
% Circuit languages are also adequate for those who are already experienced with quantum programming.
% Second, there are the quantum-annealing family of languages, which can actually provide abstraction, but limit the scope of solvable problems.
% Third, there are existing attempts at higher-level universal gate languages.
% 
% I'll chose one example from each class:
%  - Most of the circuit languages are more or less equivalent. They allow a basic gate set (H, CNOT, etc) and measurement. Rigetti pyquil offers hybrid instructions, which makes it a slight step above previous circuit languages. Essentially, this class of languages is for expressing raw quantum circuits in code, while intentionally electing not to offer abstractions. This class of languages will be useful to compile into.
%  - QA-Prolog: A quantum-annealer compiler for a subset of prolog. It is similar to a lot of other quantum annealing languages. Essentially, users can express problems in a very similar format to how problems are expressed classically, but users can only express a restricted subset of problems. Quantum annealers have their uses, but, generally speaking, they are not as powerful or general as gate-model computers. The abstraction offered, however, is worth mimicking.
%  - Robert Tucci's work ("Quantum Fog", "Qubiter"): Tucci's work offers modeling of bayesian networks on quantum computers, and is an interesting sister project to this one. I think that this is moving in the correct direction, by balancing usefulness with expressivity.
% 
%  Considering each of the above, I believe that there is an interesting gap to be filled: That of a language which offers lightweight abstractions, but still allows the general power of quantum computing.
% Of course, this is a big goal, and likely one that will only be partially fulfilled.
% I believe that it's better to attempt making something, even just a prototype of a prototype, because this will allow us to learn how to design quantum programming languages of the future.
% I'm reminded of the history of the C programming language: Dennis Ritchie's and Brian Kernighan's C is the basis for a large part of modern software. 
% However, before it, there was B and BCPL, as well as languages before that.
% The goal of this project is to write the precursor to one of these languages: I'd like to create minimal abstractions that allow for easier modeling.
% 
% There are some easy targets for providing abstraction: common things like functions, conditionals, loops, integer data types, and so on. 
% However, let's jump into the quantum/probabilistic side of things.
% 
% Models will fundamentally be composed of, generally, wave functions: Superpositions over all possible states.
% First, consider modeling a classical distribution. 
% We can successfully produce sampleable classical distributions on a quantum computer.
% For instance, consider the following model from the Church programming language tutorial.
% This code is specifying a probabilistic grammar for simple sentences about cooking.
% 
% ```scheme
% (define (transition nonterminal)
%   (case nonterminal
%         (('D) (multinomial(list (list (terminal 'the))
%                                 (list (terminal 'a)))
%                           (list (/ 1 2) (/ 1 2))))
%         (('N) (multinomial (list (list (terminal 'chef))
%                                  (list (terminal 'soup))
%                                  (list (terminal 'omelet)))
%                            (list (/ 1 3) (/ 1 3) (/ 1 3))))
%         (('V) (multinomial (list (list (terminal 'cooks))
%                                  (list (terminal 'works)))
%                            (list (/ 1 2) (/ 1 2))))
%         (('A) (multinomial (list (list (terminal 'diligently)))
%                            (list (/ 1 1))))
%         (('AP) (multinomial (list (list 'A))
%                             (list (/ 1 1))))
%         (('NP) (multinomial (list (list 'D 'N))
%                             (list (/ 1 1))))
%         (('VP) (multinomial (list (list 'V 'AP)
%                                   (list 'V 'NP))
%                             (list (/ 1 2) (/ 1 2))))
%         (('S) (multinomial (list (list 'NP 'VP))
%                            (list (/ 1 1))))
%         (else 'error)))
% ```
% 
% More succinctly, this is specifying the following (toy) language model:
% ```scheme
% D(eterminer):      (uniform 'the' 'a')
% N(oun):            (uniform 'chef' 'omelet' 'soup')
% V(erb):            (uniform 'cooks' 'works')
% A(dverb):          (uniform 'diligently')
% AP(Adverb Phrase): (uniform A)
% NP(Noun Phrase):   (D, N)
% VP(Verb Phrase):   (uniform (V AP) (V NP))
% S(entence):        (NP, VP)
% ```
% 
% What's the best way to model something like this on a quantum computer?
% To make things even simpler, let's first just consider modeling a randomly sampled Noun-Phrase (which is the first part in sampling a full toy sentence).
% The noun-phrase is a concatenation of a determiner and a noun. In our toy example, we have two determiners and three nouns, both uniformly sampled, which makes for a total of six options with equal probability.
% So, we'll need three qubits to model this. Curry has builtins for these distributions.
% ```scheme
% (def determiner-qubit 0)
% (def noun-qubits 1 2)
% (bernoulli 0.5 determiner-qubit)
% (multinomial 0.33 0.33 0.34 noun-qubits)
% ```
% 
% The output is the following (using a local simulator):
% ```
% grid {curry}: ./compile examples/test.lisp
% 
% [['def', 'determiner-qubit', '0'],
%  ['def', 'noun-qubits', '1', '2'],
%  ['bernoulli', '0.5', 'determiner-qubit'],
%  ['multinomial', '0.33', '0.33', '0.34', 'noun-qubits']]
% 
% {'000': 0.17, '001': 0.16, '010': 0.17, '011': 0.17, '100': 0.16, '101': 0.16}
%

% In our output, the rightmost bit is representing the determiner, and the other two bits are representing the noun.
% So the output is:
% ```python3
% {'the chef' : 1/6, 'a chef' : 1/6, 'the omelet' : 1/6, 'a omelet' : 1/6, 'the soup' : 1/6, 'a soup' : 1/6}
% ```
% Curry contains functionality to decode what these bits mean, but I will explain this in detail later.
% 
% Now, let's consider the rest of the model.
% When we sample a Verb Phrase, it contains recursive elements.
% So, it will branch (with equal probabilities) to either (V AP) or (V NP).
% Before diving in, let's look at branching in quantum computers.
% 
% Consider preparing a bell state:
% ```
% (h 0)
% (cnot 0 1)
% ```
% And distinguish this from the following, which will produce the same classical measurements, but no entanglement (because the state of the first qubit is known before producing the state in the second qubit). 
% In this case, the state 01 is possible, because the first qubit may be measured in the 1 state, and the second qubit is unprepared, and in the zero state.
% ```
% (bernoulli 0.5 0)
% (measure 0 0)
% (if 0 (x 1) (nop))
% ```
% 
% So, when creating a probabilistic model which branches, we distinguish between these two types of branching, because only one truly creates an entangled state.
% However, this makes representing information slightly more difficult, because we will not know which bits correspond to which states (unless we encode this, which we will).
% 
% First, consider an example that produces the probability distribution:
% `[1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/8, 1/8, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12]`.
% We can produce this by a simple:
% ```scheme
% (def space 0 3)
% (multinomial 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/8, 1/8, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12 space)
% ```
% But obviously this requires computing the distribution in advance.
% Another possibility is the following:
% ```
% (def workspace 1 2)
% (bernoulli 0.5 0) ; Deciding NP or VP
% (clear 0 0)
% (if 0 
%     ; if NP
%     (do (bernoulli 0.5 0) ; Deciding D of NP
%         (uniform 3 1 2))  ; Deciding N of NP
%     ; if VP
%     (do (bernoulli 0.5 0) ; Deciding V,AP or V,NP
%         (clear 0 0)
%         (if 0
%             ; if V,AP
%             (bernoulli 0.5 0)) ; Deciding V of V,AP
%             ; if V,NP
%             (do (bernoulli 0.5 0)  ; Deciding V of V, NP
%                 (bernoulli 0.5 1)  ; Deciding D of NP
%                 (uniform 3 2 3)))) ; Deciding N of NP
% ```
% 
% Still, there's a better way, and that's what's currently in progress:
% 
% ```
% ...
% ```

\section{Untitled}

Since quantum computers are generally only better at specialized tasks [TODO: Cite?], it makes more sense for quantum computation to be hybridized: to utilize both classical and quantum computers.
This philosophy is largely exhibited by Rigetti pyquil, which is callable from the Python programming language, which is widely used in today's software development. 
While Curry is a standalone language that compiles into Rigetti pyquil, it will also be available as a Python library, such that Python programmers can simply use their existing knowledge

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)

\appendices
\section{}
Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
\section{}
Appendix two text goes here.


% use section* for acknowledgment
