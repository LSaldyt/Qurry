\begin{abstract}
For Nature, the abstract is really an introductory paragraph set
in bold type.  This paragraph must be ``fully referenced`` and
less than 180 words for Letters.  This is the thing that is
supposed to be aimed at people from other disciplines and is
arguably the most important part to getting your paper past the
editors.  End this paragraph with a sentence like ``Here we
show...`` or something similar.
\end{abstract}

\begin{methods}
Put methods in here.  If you are going to subsection it, use
\verb|\subsection| commands.  Methods section should be less than
800 words and if it is less than 200 words, it can be incorporated
into the main text.

\subsection{Method subsection.}

Here is a description of a specific method used.  Note that the
subsection heading ends with a full stop (period) and that the
command is \verb|\subsection{}| not \verb|\subsection*{}|.

\end{methods}

%% Put the bibliography here, most people will use BiBTeX in
%% which case the environment below should be replaced with
%% the \bibliography{} command.

% to 30.
% \bibitem{dummyb} No compound references -- only one source per
